NFS MOUNT PARAMS
Altered default nfs mount parameters (in advanced options) to use nfs v4
in an attempt to reduce dropouts (which I hypothesize are due to
inadequate readahead).  I have not yet set the readahead explicitly but
the read and write sizes now seem to be greater.

SEE IF WE CAN GET ALBUM ART THE WAY THAT RUNE DOES IT - it seems to do a
better job.

GET USB INPUT DEVICE WORKING

ADD COLOR CHANGE TO VOLUME CONTROL IF VOL IS OVER VARIOUS THRESHOLDS?
